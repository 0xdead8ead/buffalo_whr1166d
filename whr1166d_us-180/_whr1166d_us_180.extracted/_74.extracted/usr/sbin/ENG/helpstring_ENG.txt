This is synonymous with specifying the TCP port 123. (It is not necessary to specify the port number.)</li> <li><b>IMAP (TCP port:143)</b><br> Translate communications with IMAP server. This is synonymous with specifying the TCP port 143. (It is not necessary to specify the port number.)</li> </ul>
LAN-side IP Address
Enter the IP address of the LAN-side network device the ports will be forwarded to. This will be the IP address of the server to be used for network games, applications, etc. This will be left blank by default.<br>If an IP address is distributed dynamically from a DHCP server, and the IP address of your PC has changed because the DHCP lease expired, port forwarding may have to be reconfigured. In this case, it is recommended that you configure DHCP to give a fixed IP address to the LAN-side network device used with port forwarding.
Note:
Packets cannot be transferred to LAN-side devices if the LAN-side IP address is configured on another network segment.
LAN-side Port
When TCP/UDP is specified as the forwarding protocol and a single port number is specified, the LAN side port number should be changed. This port will almost always be the same as the one selected under Protocol. You can set port numbers from 1-65535 (multiple port numbers cannot be specified at once).

Glossary
Description of words related to the AirStation.
Hexadecimal
Base 16; each digit of a hexadecimal number may have 16 values. 0 to 9 and A to F are used to distinguish values from 0 to 15 for each digit of a Hexadecimal number. The AirStation uses hexadecimal numbers for <a href="../help/help_glossary.html#MACADDR">MAC Address</a> and entering encryption keys.<br> The small letters a to f can be used instead of capital letters.
Back
AES
AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is an encryption technique.  TKIP improved WEP's weaknesses&#x2C; but AES takes encryption further&#x2C; Throughput decreases 10 to 20 percent when TKIP software encoding is used. AES doesn't decrease performance at all because it uses a hardware co-processor.
Internet
The Internet is a world wide network of many connected small&#x2C; medium&#x2C; and large networks. To access the internet&#x2C; a user must be connected to it via a modem or broadband connection
ICMP Protocol
ICMP stands for Internet Control Message Protocol&#x2C;  an IP protocol to get or notify of network status. For example&#x2C; the ping command uses ICMP echo request/reply to confirm connection with a server.

Method of Acquiring IP Address
Select one of the following methods to acquire an IP address. Refer to your ISP for any other information about your line format. If you're not sure which method to choose, select "Perform Easy Setup".
Perform Easy Setup &#x28;Internet Connection Wizard&#x29;
Easy Setup determines your Internet connection type. The correct setup wizard for your Internet connection is then activated automatically.
Note:
Easy Setup works best with DHCP and PPPoE connections. Contact your ISP if you are using another connection type.<br>
Acquire an IP address automatically from a DHCP server
Acquire an IP address from a DHCP server on the Internet automatically. If you have a CATV connection (cable modem)&#x2C; your ISP probably uses a DHCP server. If so&#x2C; your modem will connect to the network automatically&#x2C; with no manual configuration necessary.
Use PPPoE client
The PPPoE ISP provides you an IP address. Refer to your PPPoE provider if you are prompted for any other information such as username or password.
PPPoE communication is not initiated until all PPPoE connection information is entered, even if the PPPoE format is selected.
Use IP Unnumbered
Refer to your ISP if you need help configuring the device for IP unnumbered.
IP Unnumbered requires PPPoE destination information to activate. Contact your ISP if you do not have this information.
Use this address
Select "Use this address" and manually enter the IP address and subnet mask.
Advanced Settings
Only change these if you know what you're doing!
Default Gateway
Specify the IP address of the gateway.
If you are configuring the IP address manually, set the gateway manually as well.
The default gateway is set automatically if you are using DHCP or PPPoE. An invalid gateway will make you unable to access the Internet.
DNS Name Server Address
Enter the IP address of the DNS server.
<li>If your ISP requires that you use a specific DNS server address&#x2C; configure it here.</li> <li>If you have manually set a specific fixed IP address as the WAN-side IP address, configure a DNS server address here as well.</li> <li>If DHCP or PPPoE doesn't give you a DNS server automatically (or if you choose not to use the DNS server they provide)&#x2C; you may configure a DNS server here.</li>
The DNS server address set here manually has a higher priority than that assigned from a DHCP server or PPPoE server. Up to 5 DNS server addresses can be managed by the AirStation.
Internet MAC Address
Specify the MAC address of the Internet port. Do not change this unless required to do so by your ISP.
If an incorrect MAC address is set&#x2C; not only the AirStation but also other devices on the network may lose the ability to communicate.
Wired Internet Communication Format

__no use__
WMM-EDCA Parameters
It is usually not necessary to change this value.
Priority
The priority is ranked (Highest)8 : (High)4 : (Normal)2 : (Low)1 for each packet.
Parameter
CWmin, CWmax
The maximum and minimum value for the contention window. The contention window is used to control the frame collision avoidance system in IEEE802.11.
AIFSN
Interval of the sending frame. The unit defines a time-slot (similar to the window value of CWmin, CWmax). Lower values define a higher priority as the back-off algorithm starts earlier.
TXOP Limit
The time for the queue to obtain send priority. The minimum value is 32ms. Large values can send more frames at a time. However, latency may increase.<br> Only one frame is transferred at the time when the TXOP Limit is 0.
Admission Control
This limits the assignment of send frames per queue. If the queue exceeds the threshold new send frames are assigned to a lower queue.
