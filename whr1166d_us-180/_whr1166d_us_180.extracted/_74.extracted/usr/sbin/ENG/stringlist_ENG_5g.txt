If IPv6 passthrough is enabled in a wireless environment, the multicast rate should be set higher than the distributed bit rate. Note: IGMP snooping can decrease network traffic by not broadcasting multicast packets.
Also, multicast packets are transferred faster to devices that support multicast packet conversion.
A multicast rate of about twice the distributed bit rate is recommended.
The higher the multicast rate is, the shorter the available distance for multicast communication becomes.

TKIP is an encryption method that is slightly more secure than WEP. Not all devices support it.
AES is one of the most robust encryption methods available. It is highly recommended as long as your wireless clients support it.
WPA-PSK and WPA2-PSK authenticate wireless clients's credentials with a pre-shared key. Only wireless clients which have the same PSK as the AirStation will be permitted to access the AirStation. 
WPA/WPA2 mixed mode-PSK allows the authentication of WPA-PSK and WPA2-PSK clients at the same time.
